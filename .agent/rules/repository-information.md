- job form filler
    - there will be a form with multiple fields
    - user email, phone and other important fields
    - user will fill once and it is saved in local storage
    - when user visits a form use chrome auto fill to fill the form
- job match scorer given a job description and resume
    - this actis simillar to job filler and provides only on the go
    - this takes the job description of a post in linkedin on any other webpage
    - takes the content of the resume . (we will use gemini3 model from google for this)
    - uses llm to provide job match score and also tells me what needs to be updated in the resume
    - this will also be manually valled simillar to job filler
    - i'll clicl, calculate match score and update resume
    - then only it is invoked

each features should be in their own folder and should be in their own module.
